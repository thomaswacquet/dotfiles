# This script defines just a mode for rofi instead of being a self-contained
# executable that launches rofi by itself. This makes it more flexible than
# running rofi inside this script as now the user can call rofi as one pleases.
# For instance:
#
#   rofi -show powermenu -modi powermenu:./rofi-power-menu
#
# See README.md for more information.
